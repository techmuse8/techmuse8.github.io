# Introductory Blog Intro Post
Hi GBATempers (or whatever terms you guys use), now decided to take a crack at blogging (for real). This will be the introductory blog so expect some mistakes :P.

I am techmuse. I am into game modding, console hacking, using hardware and software. Favorite games are Rayman Origins, Super Mario Galaxy, and Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness.
Mainly like modding the NSMB series (Wii onwards specifically, not super into modding NSMBDS.) Also kinda consider myself a 3DW modder.

Probably will go into more of how I got into game modding in a later entry.

That's all for now!
