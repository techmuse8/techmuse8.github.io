# Overview
Hello, World to you all and more specifically, GitHub!
Hello again. I am techmuse. You can call me tech or muse. I decided to make a GitHub site because it seems all the cool kids these days do.

As you can see, I recently converted it to MarkDown to make it look nicer! If there is anything weird open an issue on the GitHub.

This site is in okish stages so if you would like to request something open a PR [here](https://github.com/techmuse8/techmuse8.github.io/pulls).

If theres anything bugged open an issue [here](https://github.com/techmuse8/techmuse8.github.io/issues).
Check my stuff [here](https://techmuse8.github.io/Misc/Plugs/)

Thank you for reading this and I will see you in the next one.
