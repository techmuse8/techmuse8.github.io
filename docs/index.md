# Overview
Hello, World to you all and more specifically, GitHub!
Hello again. I am techmuse. You can call me tech or muse. I decided to make a GitHub site because it seems all the cool kids these days do. I am primarily into Nintendo games and game modding. Primarily games such as Mario Kart, Splatoon, Zelda, Smash, and others like Celeste and Sonic.

This site is in okish stages so if you would like to request something open a PR [here](https://github.com/techmuse8/techmuse8.github.io/pulls).

If theres anything bugged open an issue [here](https://github.com/techmuse8/techmuse8.github.io/issues).

Check my socials [here](https://techmuse8.github.io/Misc/Plugs/).

Thank you for reading this and I will see you in the next one.
