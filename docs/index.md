# Hello, World to you all and more specifically, GitHub!

### Hello again. I am techmuse. You can call me tech or muse. I decided to make this GitHub site 
because all the cool kids do it seems these days.

### As you can see, I recently converted it to MarkDown to make it look nicer! If there is anything weird open an issue on the GitHub.

### This site is in very early stages so open a pull request to see what I could improve as time goes on and I plan to add more.

### Thank you for reading this and I will see you in the next one.
